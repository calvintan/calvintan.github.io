For example, it could be about how to <strong>better articulate your ideas and design decisions</strong>, or to <strong>improve on your design workflow</strong>.</p><p>Next, you can either:</p><ol><li>Have a chat with them, ask them for tips or advice</li><li>Get together with your team or manager to organise learning sessions</li><li>Do your own research, look up books or tutorials on the subject matter</li></ol><h3 id="ask-for-feedback-early">Ask for feedback early</h3><p>Share drafts of your design work early, even if it’s rough.</p><p>You might be thinking: “But it looks terrible! Won’t this reflect poorly on my design ability?” I feel that sharing your work early has the opposite effect. It makes you seem proactive, and that you are doing your due dilligence in finding the right solution.</p><p>It also tests if you can explain your design decisions clearly to another team member, helps to find any potential gaps in your thinking, and clarifies your understanding of the problem that you’re trying to solve.</p><p>In short, doing this will help improve your skill in articulating your ideas, which is a crucial skillset for any designer.</p><h3 id="set-goals">Set goals</h3><p>Commit to a goal, and share it with your team.</p><h3 id="work-on-a-side-project-that-youre-passionate-about">Work on a side project that you’re passionate about</h3><h3 id="teach-others">Teach others</h3></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 19, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalvintan.github.io%2F5-ways-to-upskill-as-a-designer%2F&amp;via=calvinthetan&amp;text=5%20ways%20to%20upskill%20as%20a%20designer" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://calvintan.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalvintan.github.io%2F5-ways-to-upskill-as-a-designer%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://calvintan.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://calvintan.github.io/authors/calvin/" rel="author">Calvin</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://calvintan.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://calvintan.github.io/the-first-commit/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> The &quot;first commit&quot;</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="calvinthetan" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://calvintan.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2022 to Forever | Calvin T</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://calvintan.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
